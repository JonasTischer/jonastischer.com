For many people, ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) may just be another passing trend, but for me, it represent a major technological milestone that will change our lives in ways that we can't even imagine.

Think about how life changed with the advent of the Internet and Google. Can you imagine going back to a time when you had to rely on phone books or encyclopedias for information? The Internet and Google revolutionized the way we access information and made our lives so much easier and more efficient. And now, we have LLMs taking this revolution to the next level.

I remember a few years ago, when I once got asked in a job interview what my greatest skill was, I answered "I'm great at Googling". It may sound simple, but being able to navigate the internet, find relevant information quickly, and effectively formulate search queries is one of the most important skills in today's world and still greatly underrated.

With already over 100 million users, ChatGPT has become the fastest adopted app on the internet, and it's easy to see why. It offers us a new level of convenience, allowing us to access information and get answers to our questions faster than ever before. 

However, this new technology also brings new challenges. The abundance of information available on the internet can be overwhelming, with a lot of misinformation and false information floating around. The key is to learn how to navigate this newfound wealth of information, develop an intuition for valuable prompts, and exercise critical thinking when evaluating the information.

As with any new technology, some people will embrace it, while others will be left behind. Those who are able to use LLMs to their advantage will see increased productivity, better health, and wealth. On the other hand, those who are unable to keep up with the changing times will be marginalized and left behind.

With the impending release of GPT-4, the future looks even brighter. The era of LLMs is just beginning, and I'm excited to see how it will change and improve our lives in the years to come. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a skeptic, one thing is for sure - LLMs are here to stay, and it's up to us to make the most of their many benefits.
