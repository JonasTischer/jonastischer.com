Welcome to my Personal Blog!

I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts and experiences with you through writing in 2023. In my opinion, it's never too late to pursue a personal passion, and for me, that's writing. Writing has brought so many positive impacts to my life, and I want to continue improving and growing as a writer.

While writing is a great hobby, writing in public is a whole different experience. I'm looking forward to stepping out of my comfort zone and putting my writing skills to the test. By sharing my writing with you, I'm making a commitment to myself to stay consistent and put in the effort to create meaningful content for you and myself. 

Eventually leading to building my own [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) which also serves as my [Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/). Bringing those two concepts together I have to immediately think about the Tree of Voices from Avatar.

So, let's embark on this journey together! I can't wait to see what the future holds and where this blog will take us.
