In 2019, I began my Chinese language learning journey with the ambition becoming fluent in the language and starting my career in China. What started as a goal has since transformed into a passionate hobby, constantly pushing me out of my comfort zone and exposing me to a world of unique experiences. In this article, I'll take you back to the beginning of my journey, how I got to live in China, the lessons I've gained along the way, and my plans for the future.

## Why I chose to learn Chinese

In 2017, while I was pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Mannheim, I was given the opportunity to study abroad on the beautiful island of Taiwan for a semester. This was not only one of the best times of my life but it also greatly impacted my future choices
Although I barely mastered the basics during my time there, I still remember the excitement I felt when I was trying to communicate with locals in Chinese bringing a smile to their faces.
Upon my return to Germany, I was determined to pursue my goal of learning Chinese. This drive was fueled by three main reasons:

1. The opportunity to connect with the 1.4 billion Chinese speakers worldwide, who have a rich and diverse culture that differs greatly from my own.
2. The challenge and excitement of learning one of the most difficult languages for German speakers, with its fascinating characters and history.
3. The potential for career growth, as Germany has strong trade relationships with China and a significant portion of the country's wealth is tied to the Chinese market.

## Living in China

When I set myself the goal to learn Chinese, I quickly realized that I would have to go to China in order to properly immerse myself into the culture and learn the language effectively. Just learning in my spare time from Germany seemed tedious and meaningless without a clear outlook on when and how I could apply the language. Therefore, I started looking into ways to get to China.

Thankfully, Germany has a great system of scholarships for various study purposes, and my search paid off when I came across a scholarship program that would send people to China for 16 months. The program offered a unique opportunity to study Chinese language full-time at the Beijing Foreign Languages University for 10 months and with a practical part of working in China for 6 months afterwards. 

Due to my clear ambitions and desire to go to China I was able to get a spot in this highly competitive scholarship program and I was thrilled when I heard that I will have the chance to go to China.

In August 2019, I graduated from my University and immediately set off for China. It was like a dream come true for me, and I was thrilled to have the chance to live and learn in the country that I had always been fascinated by. During my time in China, I was fully dedicated to studying the language, with only a few organized networking events by the scholarship on the side. I felt truly grateful for this incredible opportunity and was eager to make the most of it.

## Learning from home

However, at the beginning of 2020, when the pandemic hit China severely, I was forced to return to my home country and soon after, the borders to return to China closed. As a result, I had to continue the rest of my Chinese studies online for another 6 months.

For many people, the pandemic brought about significant changes in their lives. For me, it marked an abrupt end to a dream. With no clear prospects for returning to China in the near future, I had to start working in my home country and give up the idea of starting my professional career there. Nonetheless, my goal of learning Chinese remained alive and I found ways to stay motivated to continue my studies in my spare time after work.

I will share the study resources and habits that have helped me stay on track in a separate post.

## Lessons Learned - Top 5 Personal Learning

- **Learning Chinese is a Marathon, Not a Sprint**: I've come across this quote many times in language learning forums and I can fully relate to it. At first, I thought I could learn Chinese within a year, but now I realize that learning Chinese is a lifelong pursuit. Consistency is key, and it's important not to overburden yourself, as you may quickly become burned out.

- **Make a study plan and stick to it**. To make steady progress in my Chinese studies, I found it helpful to plan out my studies in advance and make sure to allocate dedicated time each week to language practice. Whether it's daily reviewing vocabulary, weekly lessons with a tutor, or regular practice with native speakers, having a structured study plan helps me stay accountable and on track. Additionally, I like to set intermediate milestones for myself, such as passing a certain level of the HSK exam or being able to hold basic conversations in Chinese, to help keep my motivation levels up and see tangible progress.

- **Treat Chinese as a Hobby, Not an Investment**: One of the main reasons I started studying Chinese was the potential for high-paying job opportunities. However, I've learned that companies rarely search for people who only have a mediocre level of Chinese, especially in my field of software development. So, instead of treating Chinese as an investment, I now see it as an intellectual hobby that gives me access to a whole new culture and broadens my horizons. This mindset has helped me to stay motivated, as I know it will never have a negative return in that sense.

- **Try Different Approaches**: There are a million apps, books, podcasts, movies, and series available to help you learn Chinese. Don't be afraid to try different methods, even if it means wasting some time and money. In the end, it's important to find resources that you're interested in and that keep you motivated.

- **It's Not Always Fun**: Learning Chinese, especially the characters, can be challenging and requires a lot of effort. Studying at home, in particular, can be lonely, boring, and unmotivating at times. But it's important to remember that this is normal and to keep pushing forward.

## Current level and goals 

*"So, have you become fluent in Chinese now?"*

The answer is a **Hell NO"**. Learning Chinese is indeed a long-term commitment and fluency is a subjective concept. My ultimate goal is to use Chinese in a professional setting, and I still have a long way to go.

However, I have now reached a level where I can read books, watch series, and communicate with locals with a degree of enjoyment, without feeling overly frustrated. I consider this a significant achievement and I am proud of my progress so far.

I am eagerly looking forward to returning to China to put my language skills to use and get closer to my goal of being able to use Chinese in a work environment. As soon as I have a clear return date, I will redouble my efforts to master the language.

Until then, I am content with my slow but steady progress day by day.


## Conclusion

I believe that learning any language is a highly enriching hobby that I want to continue pursuing throughout my life. It has become such a fundamental part of my routine that I don't want to give it up.

However, learning Chinese has been a particularly challenging experience for me. There have been moments when I questioned whether it was worth all the effort. But then I think about all the positive experiences that Chinese has brought me. 

I've made new friends, both Chinese and non-Chinese, who share similar interests. It has opened up new doors and valuable networks. I've been exposed to an entirely new world of information, resources, people, and apps that have expanded my perspectives on many aspects of life.

I hope my journey with learning Chinese has inspired you to start or continue your own language learning journey. No matter how challenging it may seem, the rewards and personal growth that come with it are truly invaluable. I am excited to continue sharing my experiences and progress on my blog and I look forward to seeing where this path takes me in the future.
